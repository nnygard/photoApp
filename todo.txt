1. Add/Remove Collections
2. Add/Remove Images
3. Refactor loadAlbums to be able to target Collection only (And maybe image only)
4. NightMode Bug

-Landscape overflow on authScreen

-Option to Group Collections
-Next Collection on scroll to bottom
-merge fullscreendata like collectionEditData
-Collection Title stick to navbar on scroll
-Style up CollectionView picture frame
-JSS CSS in Javascript?

-Remove divider in between "Album" and collections menu.js?

Admin Logic
  +Add Collection from menu drawer "+"
      -Creates a folder in storage
      -Creates a reference object [title, subTitle, path, index, images[]]
  +Remove Collection from inside collection (only when no images are present)
      -Removes folder from storage
      -Removes reference object
  +Add image "+" at bottom of collection package
      -Creates an image in storage folders
      -Creates a reference object in images folder object [description, path, index]
