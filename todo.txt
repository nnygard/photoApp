-Landscape overflow on Authscreen

Maybe:
-Application for uppload and administration
-Function for numpad in authScreen.js
-Migrate images from application to backend
-DefaultScreen External Data File
-Style up CollectionView picture frame
-Remove divider in between "Album" and collections menu.js??
